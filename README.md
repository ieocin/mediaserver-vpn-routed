# mediaserver-vpn-routed
OpenVPN routed docker compose for media downloads

# usage
configure the file to fit your needs, then create a folder to place it in.
to start the containers, navigate to the folder containing the `docker-compose.yml`, then

run `# docker-compose up`

or `# docker-compose up -d` to start the containers in the background.

# playback
i recommend setting up something like [jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) and having it search your media-folders, but you can use anything you like.
